In Interstellar Hangover, you are an alien who has done some unspeakable things during an
all-out bender with a space prince. Your goal is to find out what you did that made so many
people want to kill you and to find your way home. Subgoals include finding out the mischief
partaken in last night and using the least amount of gas (playtime) and force field time to win
each level. You must shoot your way through seven levels, uncovering more pieces of the story
on the way. You can move with the WASD keys and aim with the mouse. Left Clicking will
shoot a bullet. After you have unlocked them, you can place mines with Q, activate your
forcefield with F, and finally you can activate your power ups with E. The core mechanic of this
game is moving, shooting, and enabling the player’s force field. You will lose a life if you run
out of gas, or if your health goes to zero. Once you’ve lost 3 lives, it’s game over and you’ll have
to restart the game. The target audience for this game was intended to be college students as they
can most often relate to the hungover what-did-I-do-last-night query.

The game takes place in outer space and is further contextualized by the story slides before each
level that provides background to the enemies and landscape encountered. Shooting bullets at
enemy spaceships represents an effort to keep the prince safe and make it back home. The system
of our game space contains the player, projectiles, obstacles, and enemies, all of which are
confined to moving within an arena object.

There are two main forms of rules in our game: operational rules and constitutive rules. As far as
operational rules, the player cannot advance until all enemies are defeated; the player loses if
they take too much damage, and the player must stay within the boundaries and cannot move or
shoot through obstacles. The constitutive rules of our game include using WASD to move, the
Mouse for a projectile, F and E keys for the force field, and power-ups. In addition to this, there
are also many intuitive rules around the player's and enemy's collisions. When the player or an
enemy object collides with a bullet of their opponent's type, their health value is decreased.
When an enemy's health reaches zero, it is removed from the scene. When the player's health
reaches zero, their "lives" value is decreased by one, and a restart screen scene is loaded. Hitting
a button prompt on that screen will restart the level the player was just on. When the "lives"
value hits zero, then after a few transitions, the very first scene is loaded again. All of these rules
make for clear guidelines on how to play successfully.

Our game has many challenges presented to the player. The challenges increase as the player
moves from level to level. This can be seen in the number of enemies increasing throughout the
levels, starting at three total in level 1, and progressing to 8+ on the last level, level 6. Defeating
the enemies themselves becomes harder, too. As the game progresses, the most basic enemy
introduced in level 1 needs to be hit by five player bullets to die, while the final boss needs 50
bullet hits from the player to be defeated. In addition to the varying number of enemies and the
varying strength of enemies, new challenges are introduced as far as what the enemies' attack
types are, through the levels. The first enemies introduced, "ice blades," attack the player using
standard bullets - the same as the player. Later in the game the enemies introduced in levels 3
and 4, lay mines that restrict the player's movement space and shoot indestructible, harder to
dodge bullets. Also, in addition to these, heat-seeking missiles are introduced on level 4, which
follow the player, unlike the traditional physics-based bullet movements. A laser enemy is
introduced in level 5 as well that inflicts 60 damage units per second during contact. Lastly, the
final challenges, the mini-boss and final boss, are exceptionally difficult. The mini boss because
they spawn twice as many missiles compared to ice blades, and in addition to missiles the final
boss spawns waves of enemies into the arena. The landscape also becomes increasingly
treacherous as the player moves through the levels. In the beginning levels, there are a few
stagnant obstacles that give the player an expansive open space to move around; however, as the
player moves on, the number of obstacles increases, and they begin to have their own movement
patterns. This means the player must not only be cognizant of the enemies gaining on them, but
they also must be aware of the surrounding terrain so as to not be pushed closer to an enemy by a
moving asteroid.

Complexity is introduced throughout the game, partially through the six different enemy types
but also through the new power-ups introduced to the player. These power-ups increase the
complexity of the game because they provide an opportunity for the player to think critically
about their movement in the game and their enemies' likely next movements and locations. In the
beginning, the player only has access to the WASD keys, shooting, and the force field. However,
as the game progresses, the player can use more complex tactics to harm the enemies, including
laying mines of their own (using the mine-laying power-up) and via the wormholes that allow the
player to teleport across the playing field and be outputted on the opposite end of the screen.
